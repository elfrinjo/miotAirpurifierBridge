# POC: Xiaomi Airpurifier 3H MQTT Bridge
This is a proof-of-concept, lacking a lot of errorhandling.

The Xiaomi Airpurifier 3H uses the (new) miot api.
This script bridges the air pufifier to the following state and control topics in mqtt.

These topics are reported from the device:

| STATE Topic                         | Values to expect             | Meaning                                                                    |

## Prerequisits
- Python 3
- PAHO MQTT-Client module
- python-miio > 5.0.1 (available from PIP) 
- The devices security token

## Usage
- Copy airpurifier.conf.sample to airpurifier.conf
- Adjust the values in airpurifier.conf
- Run miotAirpurifierBridge.py

Set the environment `airpurifierConfigFile` to use a different configfile.

### systemd
The systemd folder conatins a systemd service that can be customized and dropped
into `/etc/systemd/system`. It assumes the `miotAirpurifierBridge.py` script is
located in `/opt/miotAirpurifierBridge/`
